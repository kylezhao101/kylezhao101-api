# Dynamic Site Generation Using MDX and Next.js

This site leverages the power of MDX and Next.js to automate and enhance the documentation and article writing process, allowing for a seamless user experience and efficient content management.

**1. Automated Navigation:** By organizing our content into MDX files within specific folders, the site automatically generates navigation elements. This setup allows each folder and MDX file to correspond to a unique section and page on the website, making it easy to expand or modify content.

**2. Navbar Generation:** The dynamic routing and navigation mechanism ensures that the navigation bar is always up-to-date with new sections, making it effortless to navigate through the site.

**3. Faster Documentation:** Writing articles or documentation using the MDX format combines the simplicity of Markdown with the flexibility of React components. The integration with 'next-mdx-remote' makes it possible to import custom components into the documentation, allowing for rich, interactive content that accelerates the creation process.

These functionalities are primarily implemented in `fetchers.ts` and `sidebargenerator`.

## Folder Structure Example



```
src/
└── app/

        └── mdx-content/
            └── about-this-site/
                └── dynamic-site-generation.mdx
            └── resume-api-endpoints/
                └── all-data.mdx
                └── education.mdx
                └── experience.mdx
                └── project.mdx
